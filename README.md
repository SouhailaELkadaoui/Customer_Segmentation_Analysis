## Customer Segmentation and Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation and analysis using Excel and Power BI. The primary objective was to categorize customers based on their buying behavior and visualize these insights for better decision-making.

## Methodology
### Customer Segmentation
Using Excel functions, I segmented customers based on the following key metrics:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency: How often they make purchases 

Purchase Amount 


Monetary Value: Total spending of each customer 

Spending Score: Customer's tendency to spend based on their purchasing behavior 

### Data Visualization
After segmentation, I imported the data into Power BI to create visualizations, which allowed for deeper analysis and insights. The visualizations included:


Category Distribution: Displaying the number of clients across different categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, etc.)

Revenue Trends: Tracking revenue variations over the years to observe trends and seasonality

Gender Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of customers by gender within each category to identify gender-based spending patterns 

 
## Key Insights
The analysis provided insights into: 


Top Categories: Identification of categories with the highest number of clients and revenue contributions 

Spending Trends: Understanding customer spending patterns and seasonality in purchasing behavior 

Gender-Based Insights: Discovering gender preferences in different categories and segments

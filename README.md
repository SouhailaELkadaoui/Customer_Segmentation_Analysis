In this project, I used Excel functions to create customer segmentations based on key metrics such as Recency, Frequency, Purchase Amount, Monetary Value, and Spending Score. This allowed me to categorize customers effectively and analyze their buying behavior. Following this segmentation, I leveraged Power BI to visualize the distribution of clients across different categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, etc.), track revenue variations over the years, and analyze gender distribution within each segment. The analysis provided insights into which categories have the highest number of clients, identified trends in customer spending patterns, and highlighted revenue contributions by gender across various segments.
